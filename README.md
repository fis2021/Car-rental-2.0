### Customer:
- A customer can navigate to the home page where he will be able to see a list with the best deals (today’s choice – both cars and plus services).

- A customer can also browse and discover all available cars or the provided dealer services, but to place an order a customer must login or register first.
  Each service comes with a set of photos and a unique description (for some cars the plus service is included in the price).
  
- They can apply for rental in advance and see the status of their request (accepted, declined or pending). If the order is rejected, the rejection reason will also be displayed.

- A customer can also leave a review of their experience after the rented car is returned.

### Dealer:

- After the sales representant logs in, he can add, edit, delete available cars or services.

- Also, after logging in, he will see a list of the orders for the current day.

- From the list of orders, the dealership can reject or approve an order.

- He can also reply to the customer reviews or contact them if needed.
